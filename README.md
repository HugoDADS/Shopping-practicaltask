The results from your nearest-neighbor classifier provide a strong foundation for understanding user behavior on the shopping website, particularly in identifying sessions that do not result in a purchase, as evidenced by a high true negative rate of 90.34%. However, the true positive rate of 39.13% indicates room for improvement in accurately capturing potential purchasing sessions.
To enhance the utility of the model, especially for marketing strategies aimed at boosting sales, exploring adjustments in the classification threshold, engaging in more robust feature engineering, and experimenting with different machine learning models could prove beneficial. Moreover, employing methods like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning could refine the model's accuracy and balance between sensitivity and specificity.
Ultimately, the model's effectiveness in its current state shows promise for practical application, particularly in filtering out non-purchase interactions, but further refinement is necessary to maximize its potential in identifying genuine purchase opportunities.
